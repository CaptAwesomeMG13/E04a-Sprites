# E04a-Sprites Exercise

In this project I go through the different mains and complete the objectives. For Main1 we add
a for loop to generate 20 animals across the screen. This way the original 1 animal has lots
of friends. Main2 was changed by adding a second animal and emoji box. They are now able to
"talk" to each other instead of one animal just talking to himself. Main3 added the ability
to make the moose follow the mouse around the screen. Before he was stationary in the center
of the screen which was very boring. The last bit is main4 and as you can see below, there
are quite a few steps in this one. I did not have the time to attempt this one but if you 
would like to feel free to follow the steps below. Thank you and hope you enjoyed this project.

 * main4.pyâ€”*extra credit*:
   * Find some other sprites, and make them into a collage

   * [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) or [openGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) are resources for free images
   * If you would like to make them move or react to the mouse, I will award extra points
